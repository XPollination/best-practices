## Core Principle: The 10% Rule

**If everything is bold, nothing is bold.** (Butterick, Practical Typography)

Limit bold to approximately **10% of total text**. Bold is a tool for emphasis — overuse defeats the purpose and creates visual noise that makes documents harder to scan.

## What ATS Does (and Doesn't) See

- Modern ATS (2026) **parses bold without issues** — it doesn't break formatting
- ATS does **NOT weight bold text as more important** — only placement matters
- Keyword priority by location (highest to lowest):
  1. Professional summary / profile section
  2. Job titles
  3. First 1-3 bullets per role
  4. Skills section
  5. Later bullets, education, other sections

**Implication:** Bold is for human readers, not algorithms. Place keywords strategically in high-priority zones rather than bolding them.

## Recruiter Scanning Behavior

### The 7-Second Scan (TheLadders Eye-Tracking, 2018)

Recruiters spend **7.4 seconds** on initial scan, using an **F-pattern**:
1. Horizontal scan across the top (name, title)
2. Second horizontal scan (shorter, first role)
3. Vertical scan down the left margin (job titles, company names, dates)

**Bold creates anchor points along this F-pattern.** Section headings, job titles, and company names are the structural elements that guide the eye.

### Visual Noise Threshold

Multiple studies confirm: >10% bold creates clutter that **slows scanning** rather than speeding it up. Excessive bold forces the reader to re-read because nothing stands out.

## What to Bold

### Always Bold (Structural Elements)

| Element | Treatment | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Your name | Bold, 18-24pt | Primary identifier |
| Section headings | Semibold + uppercase + letter-spacing | Top-level structure |
| Job titles | Semibold, 10pt | What you did (F-pattern anchor) |
| Key certifications | Bold within skills section | Credentials that matter |

### Use Italic Instead

| Element | Treatment | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Company names | Italic, gray | Where you did it (secondary to what) |
| Dates/locations | Regular, gray | When/where (recedes from hierarchy) |
| Subheadings | Italic or semibold | Lower-level structure |

### Debated: Keywords Within Bullet Text

**Arguments for bolding keywords in bullets:**
- Helps recruiters/headhunters match experience to requirements in 7-second scan
- Creates micro-anchors within the F-pattern's horizontal sweeps
- Useful when CV goes through a Personalberatung (headhunter) who needs to spot matches fast

**Arguments against:**
- Creates visual noise if overdone (>1 bold phrase per bullet)
- ATS doesn't weight bold — placement matters more
- Harder to read than regular weight in running text
- DACH conservative culture prefers structure over visual emphasis
- Good writing front-loads keywords naturally without needing bold

**Recommendation:** If bolding keywords within bullets, limit to **1 bold phrase per 2-3 bullets** and only for terms that directly match the target opportunity's language. Never bold action verbs or common terms.

## DACH Region Conventions

- **Austrian/German/Swiss CVs emphasize clarity and structure** over visual creativity
- Employers prefer **factual, standardized presentation**
- Bold should serve structure (headings, titles), not decoration
- **Avoid:** decorative bold, bold paragraphs, bold action verbs
- **Preferred hierarchy:** Size > Weight > Color > Spacing (in order of impact)

## Alternatives to Bold

| Technique | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Semibold (500-600)** | When full bold (700) is too heavy | Job titles, skill group headers |
| **Font size** | Primary hierarchy (sections, name) | 22pt name, 11pt headings, 9pt body |
| **Color** | Accent elements (headings, rules, bullets) | Navy for headings, steel for en-dashes |
| **Letter-spacing** | Section headings for distinguished look | 0.08em tracking on uppercase headings |
| **Whitespace** | Grouping and separation | 14pt between entries, 22pt between sections |
| **Italic** | Secondary emphasis, company names | Subtle, doesn't compete with bold |
| **Uppercase** | Section headings (with letter-spacing) | "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE" |

**Key insight:** A well-designed document uses all these tools in concert. Bold is just one layer of a multi-level hierarchy: Size → Weight → Color → Spacing → Style.

## Self-Test

1. **Print test:** Print the CV. Does your eye flow to the most important information?
2. **Squint test:** Blur your vision. What stands out? Is it the right content?
3. **7-second test:** Can someone identify your qualifications in 7 seconds from bolded elements alone?
4. **10% test:** Is less than 10% of the body text bolded?
5. **Consistency test:** Is every job title bold? Every heading? No exceptions?
