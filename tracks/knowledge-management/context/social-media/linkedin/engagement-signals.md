# Engagement Signals — What Drives LinkedIn Distribution

## The Golden Hour

The first 60-90 minutes after posting determine everything. LinkedIn shows the post to a small test group and measures:

- Do people stop scrolling? (dwell time)
- Do people comment? (conversation signal)
- Do people share or save? (value signal)

If these signals are strong, LinkedIn expands distribution. If weak, the post dies.

## Designing for Dwell Time

Dwell time = how long someone spends on your post before scrolling. It's the algorithm's proxy for "was this worth reading?"

**What increases dwell time:**
- Longer, well-structured text (but not padding — substance)
- Document/carousel posts (users swipe through slides)
- Bilingual content (more text to process, more diverse readership)
- Lists and frameworks (readers pause to evaluate each point)

**What kills dwell time:**
- Clickbait hook with no payoff
- Wall of text without formatting
- Generic advice that readers have seen before

## Designing for Comments

Comments carry 3x the weight of likes. But not all comments are equal:

- **Thoughtful multi-sentence comments** — highest signal
- **Questions** — trigger reply chains, multiplying engagement
- **One-word reactions ("Great!", "Agree")** — minimal signal
- **Engagement bait responses** — algorithm detects and penalizes

**How to invite real comments:**
- End with an open question that touches the reader's experience
- "What was the first thing that broke when your team scaled?" > "Do you agree?"
- The question should be answerable from personal experience, not require expertise

## The First Comment Strategy

Putting the blog link in the first comment (not the post body) is standard practice because:

1. LinkedIn penalizes external links in post body (reduced distribution)
2. The first comment appears directly below the post
3. The comment itself adds to the engagement count

But the first comment is more than a link dump — see [first-comment-strategy.md](first-comment-strategy.md).
