## Core Rules

### Page Count
| Experience Level | Target Pages |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Junior (0-5 years) | 1 page |
| Mid-career (5-15 years) | 1-2 pages |
| **Senior (15+ years)** | **2 pages** |
| Academic/Executive | 2-3 pages |

**DACH convention:** 2 pages is the standard for senior professionals. Unlike US resumes (1 page preferred), European CVs are expected to be more detailed.

### Layout
- **Single-column** layout (DACH standard)
- Reverse chronological order
- NO sidebar layouts — they parse poorly in DACH ATS systems (Workday, Taleo, Xing)
- Photo: **required in DACH** — top-right, 35-38mm wide

### Photo (DACH-specific)
- **Position:** Top-right, aligned with header
- **Size:** 35-38mm wide
- **Style:** Professional headshot, business attire, neutral background
- **Shape:** Rounded corners (3pt radius) feel modern without being trendy
- **Note:** DACH region expects photos on CVs. Omitting one may raise questions.

## Typography

### Font Selection
| Recommendation | Font | Why |
|---------------|------|-----|
| **Top pick** | **Inter** | Geometric, large x-height, excellent at small sizes, designed for screens but works great in print |
| Alternative | Source Sans Pro | Adobe's professional sans-serif |
| Alternative | Lato | Warm, professional feel |
| Classic | Helvetica / Arial | Safe but generic |

**Avoid:** Decorative fonts, serif fonts for headings (unless publishing/academic), Comic Sans, Papyrus.

### Font Sizes
| Element | Size | Weight |
|---------|------|--------|
| Name | 22pt | Bold |
| Section headings | 11pt | Semibold + uppercase + letter-spacing |
| Job titles | 10pt | Semibold |
| Body/bullets | 9-9.5pt | Regular |
| Dates/locations | 9pt | Regular, gray (#6b7b8d) |
| Contact info | 8.5pt | Regular, gray |

### Weight Usage (Bold Discipline)
- **Bold:** Only job titles and key phrases within bullets (~10% of text)
- **Semibold:** Section headings, skill group titles
- **Italic:** Company names (subtle emphasis, not competing with titles)
- **Regular:** Everything else

**Rule: If everything is bold, nothing is bold.** Use bold sparingly to draw the eye to key information.

### Letter-Spacing
- Section headings: 0.08em (creates a distinguished, uppercase look)
- Name: 0.02em (subtle, prevents letter collision at large sizes)
- Body text: 0 (default — never add tracking to body text)

## Color System

### 3-Color Maximum
| Color | Hex | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Navy** | `#1b3a5c` | Name, section headings |
| **Steel blue** | `#3d6b99` | Rules, en-dash bullets, tagline |
| **Dark gray** | `#2d2d2d` | Body text |
| Medium gray | `#6b7b8d` | Dates, locations, company names |

**Rule:** Maximum 3 colors plus gray shades. More = visual noise.

### Color Psychology for DACH Management
- **Navy/dark blue:** Authority, trust, professionalism — ideal for operations/management
- **Avoid orange/red:** Too informal for senior management in DACH
- **Avoid bright colors:** Can signal junior/creative roles

## Visual Elements

### Bullet Markers
- **En-dash (–)** in accent color — modern, clean
- NOT dots/circles — feel dated
- NOT arrows — too informal
- Consistent indentation: 1em from left edge

### Horizontal Rules
- Section headings: thin rule (0.5pt) in accent color below heading
- Header: slightly thicker rule (0.75pt) in navy below name block
- **NOT between entries** — use whitespace alone between entries

### Date/Location Format
- Format: `Apr 2024 – Present | Graz, Austria`
- Aligned right, separated by vertical bar
- Gray color to recede from the visual hierarchy

## ATS Compatibility (DACH)

### Dominant ATS in DACH
- **Workday** (large corporates)
- **Taleo** (Oracle — large corporates)
- **Xing/New Work** (DACH-specific platform)
- **SAP SuccessFactors** (enterprise)

### ATS Rules
1. Single-column layout parses better than multi-column/sidebar
2. Standard section headings: "Professional Experience", "Education", "Skills"
3. No text in images (ATS can't read it)
4. No tables for layout (tables confuse ATS parsers)
5. Standard fonts (Inter, Arial, Calibri — not exotic fonts)
6. Date formats should be consistent (MMM YYYY throughout)

## Content Guidelines

### Entry Structure
```
Job Title                          Date Range | Location
Company Name (italic)

– Bullet point starting with action verb
– Quantified achievement where possible
– Key skills in bold for visual scanning
```

### Bullet Points
- Start with **action verbs** (Managed, Led, Developed, Built)
- **Quantify** where possible (3 teams, 15% improvement, €2M budget)
- Bold **key phrases** that match target job descriptions (~10% of text)
- 3-6 bullets per recent role, 1-2 for older roles
- No periods at end of bullets

### Skills Section
- Group by category (Leadership, Technical, Tools, etc.)
- Use separating dots (·) between items in a single line
- Bold category names for scanning
