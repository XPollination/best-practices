## Origin

These patterns were researched and documented during the ProfileAssistant project (CV generation pipeline). They are technology-agnostic — applicable to Typst, LaTeX, CSS/HTML, and any document layout system.

## Contributing

When you discover or refine a layout pattern:
1. Document it in the appropriate file (or create a new one)
2. Include: pattern name, definition, threshold values, implementation examples, sources
3. Version bump the file header
