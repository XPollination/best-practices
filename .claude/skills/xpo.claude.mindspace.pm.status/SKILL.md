# PM Status — Cross-Project Overview

Single command to scan all project databases, present a categorized summary, then drill down into each actionable task one-by-one for human decisions.

```
/xpo.claude.mindspace.pm.status
```

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `layer1_enabled` | `true` | Enable Brain Health gardening phase. Set to `false` to skip brain health diagnostic entirely. |

When `layer1_enabled` is `false`, skip Step 1.5 (Brain Health) and proceed directly from Step 1 to Step 2.

---

## Step 1: Scan Projects + Brain Health

Run the pm-status script to scan all project databases AND get brain health in one command:

```bash
node /home/developer/workspaces/github/PichlerThomas/xpollination-mcp-server/viz/pm-status.cjs
```

This returns JSON with:
- `projects`: all tasks from best-practices, xpollination-mcp-server, and HomePage
- `brain_health`: status, recent thought count, highway count, top domains

Parse and present. Brain health section is always included — no separate step needed.

Collect all non-terminal tasks (exclude `complete`, `cancelled`) from the projects output.

Present brain health as a **BRAIN HEALTH** section:

```
=== BRAIN HEALTH ===
Status: healthy | empty | unavailable
Recent thoughts: N
Highways: N
Top domains: domain1, domain2, ...
===
```

If brain health shows issues, Thomas may choose to run a deeper gardening pass (`/xpo.claude.mindspace.garden full deep`).

## Step 2: Phase 1 — Summary Table

Present a compact overview grouped by action type:

```
=== PM STATUS (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) ===

DECISIONS NEEDED (approval — approve or rework):
  [1] task-slug (project) — approval+role

REVIEWS PENDING (review+liaison — complete or rework):
  [2] task-slug (project) — review+liaison

IN PIPELINE (no action needed now):
  [3] task-slug (project) — status+role
  [4] task-slug (project) — status+role

--- Summary: N tasks | X approvals | Y reviews | Z in-pipeline ---
```

**Categorization rules:**
- Status `approval` → **DECISIONS NEEDED** (human approves or sends to rework)
- Status `review` AND role `liaison` → **REVIEWS PENDING** (human completes or reworks)
- All other non-terminal → **IN PIPELINE** (informational, no action needed)

## Step 3: Phase 2 — Sequential Task Drill-Down

For each task in DECISIONS NEEDED + REVIEWS PENDING (ordered by category, then updated_at):

1. **Get full DNA:**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_PATH=$DB node $CLI get <slug>
   ```

2. **Present to Thomas:**
   - Title and project
   - Action type: "Approve or Rework?" / "Complete or Rework?"
   - Key DNA fields: `findings`, `implementation`, `qa_review`, `pdsa_review`, `qa_design_review`
   - Review chain trail (who reviewed, who passed)

3. **WAIT for Thomas's decision** using AskUserQuestion:
   - For approval: options are "Approve" and "Rework" (+ Other)
   - For review: options are "Complete" and "Rework" (+ Other)

4. **Execute the transition** based on decision:
   - Approve: `DATABASE_PATH=$DB node $CLI transition <slug> approved liaison`
   - Complete: `DATABASE_PATH=$DB node $CLI transition <slug> complete liaison`
   - Rework: `DATABASE_PATH=$DB node $CLI transition <slug> rework liaison`

5. **Only then** present the next task.

**CRITICAL: Never present all task details at once.** The summary is the map. Phase 2 is the decision flow — one task at a time.

## Step 4: Wrap Up

After all actionable tasks are presented and decided:
- Show remaining IN PIPELINE tasks (brief, no drill-down)
- End with: "All actionable items addressed. N tasks remain in pipeline."
