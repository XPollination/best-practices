# PDSA: v0.0.1 — Initial Specification Import

## PLAN

### Thomas's Prompts
> T2: "use xpollination-mcp-server, start the server, add a context 'bestPractices', read HomePage and structure the project so we can deploy different versions as found in ProfileAssistant/sources/cv/versions, set up v0.0.1"

### Decisions
1. **Context "bestPractices"** added to xpollination-mcp-server as a versioned source context
2. **Versioning pattern** follows ProfileAssistant: `sources/bestPractices/versions/vX.Y.Z/`
3. **v0.0.1 = spec import** — the 10 specification documents from the Thomas+Claude voice conversation (2026-02-17) are the initial content
4. **Spec lives in `spec/` subdirectory** — separate from deliverables and PDSA docs
5. **best-practices repo remains the output layer** — receives only technology/content, not the platform spec

### Scope
- Import: 10 spec documents + README from NAS into v0.0.1/spec/
- Structure: Follow ProfileAssistant versioning pattern
- PM: Create task node in mindspace for tracking

### What This Version Does NOT Do
- Does not implement any technology described in the spec
- Does not modify the existing best-practices repo
- Does not set up vector DB, knowledge graph, or any infrastructure

## DO

### Changes Made
- `sources/bestPractices/versions/v0.0.1/spec/` — 11 files (README + 01-10 spec docs)
- `sources/bestPractices/versions/v0.0.1/deliverables/` — empty (no compiled output yet)
- `sources/bestPractices/versions/v0.0.1/pdsa/` — this document
- `sources/bestPractices/README.md` — context overview

### Source Documents (from NAS)
| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| 01-SYSTEM-VISION.md | Philosophy, bubble problem, organic growth, truth anchoring |
| 02-CORE-ARCHITECTURE.md | Data flow, hybrid storage, documentation loop |
| 03-AGENT-GUIDELINES.md | Mirroring protocol, schemas, conflict resolution |
| 04-VECTOR-DB-AND-GRAPH-STRATEGY.md | Qdrant + Neo4j, embeddings, scaling |
| 05-TRUTH-ANCHORING-SYSTEM.md | Biblical grounding, scoring, theological humility |
| 06-INTEGRATION-SPEC.md | Server architecture, APIs, migration path |
| 07-CONVERSATION-TRACE-001.md | First traced conversation (Loop 1) |
| 08-MULTI-AGENT-ACCESS-LAYER.md | Model-agnostic access, guided intake |
| 09-DECENTRALIZATION-CHALLENGE.md | Token cost, distributed architecture |
| 10-CONVERSATION-TRACE-002.md | Second traced conversation (Loop 2) |

## STUDY

### Verification
- [ ] All 11 files present in v0.0.1/spec/
- [ ] Directory structure matches ProfileAssistant pattern
- [ ] PM task created in mindspace
- [ ] Committed and pushed

## ACT

### Status
In progress — initial import.

### Learnings
- The best-practices repo is the **output layer** (human-readable best practices)
- The xpollination-mcp-server is the **platform layer** (spec, PM, tooling)
- Versioning enables iterating on the spec without losing history
