# First Comment Strategy

## The Problem with "Link in Comments"

Most people treat the first comment as a link dump:
> "For anyone who wants to dig deeper — here's the article: [link]"

This is passive. It assumes the reader is already motivated enough to click. It provides no reason to click. It has no call to action.

## What the First Comment Should Do

The first comment is **part of the post**. It's the continuation, not an afterthought. It should:

1. **Add value beyond the post** — give a reason to click that the post didn't
2. **Include a clear CTA** — what should the reader do and why
3. **Address a specific audience** — not "anyone", but "if you're a CTO dealing with..."
4. **Create urgency or curiosity** — what will they learn/get that they can't get from the post alone

## Pattern

```
[1 sentence: who this is for + what they'll get]
[Link]
[Optional: 1 sentence on what's in the article that wasn't in the post]
```

## Examples

**Bad:**
> For anyone who wants to dig deeper — I explored this in a full article with the research behind it: [link]

Problems: "anyone" = no one specific. "Dig deeper" = vague. No CTA. No reason to click.

**Good:**
> If you're leading a team through this right now — I wrote about the three forces that cause it and what you can do before the friction becomes expensive: [link]

Why it works: specific audience ("leading a team through this"), specific content ("three forces"), specific benefit ("before the friction becomes expensive"), embedded CTA.

**Good (with German bridge):**
> If you're navigating this with your team right now — the full article breaks down the three forces behind it and practical approaches: [EN link]

## The Frame

Thomas's blog posts are NOT "articles he explored." They are:
- **His professional positioning** — thought leadership that demonstrates expertise
- **Content marketing for XPollination** — the blog exists to drive discovery calls
- **Service awareness** — every article connects to "this is how I work with clients"

The first comment should reflect this: "I work with teams on exactly this problem. Here's the deeper framework. If it resonates, there's a way to continue the conversation."
