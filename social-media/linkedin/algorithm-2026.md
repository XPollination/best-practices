# LinkedIn Algorithm — 2026

## How Distribution Works

LinkedIn distributes posts in stages:

1. **Initial test:** Post shown to 2-5% of your network
2. **Golden hour (0-90 min):** Algorithm measures engagement quality
3. **Expansion:** If engagement is strong → shown to 2nd and 3rd degree connections
4. **Death:** If engagement is weak in the first hour, the post dies and never gains traction

## What the Algorithm Measures

| Signal | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Dwell time** | High | How long users spend reading before scrolling. Longer = better. |
| **Comments** | 3x likes | A thoughtful multi-sentence comment counts far more than a one-word reply |
| **Comment replies** | High | Responding to comments within the first hour signals active conversation |
| **Saves** | High | Underrated signal — indicates genuine value |
| **Likes/reactions** | Baseline | Necessary but not sufficient |

## Format Performance (2026 data)

| Format | Engagement Rate | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Document/carousel (PDF) | 6.60% | Highest of any format — drives dwell time |
| Text-only | ~2% | Best reach per follower when well-formatted |
| Image + text | 30% less reach | Than identical text-only content |
| External links in body | Penalized | Always put links in first comment |

## Key Rules

- **No external links in post body** — LinkedIn deprioritizes posts that send people off-platform. Link goes in first comment.
- **Hook in first 2 lines** — visible before "...see more". This is the only content the algorithm tests against.
- **Comments > likes** — design posts that invite conversation, not just agreement.
- **Engagement bait is detected** — "Comment YES if you agree" type prompts are penalized.
